The external knowledge source stores pieces of information and their vector embeddings. At query time, the user query is embedded into the same vector space and used to retrieve similar context by calculating the closest data points.\n- Augmentation: The user query and retrieved additional context are then used to augment a prompt template.\n- Generation: The augmented prompt is used to generate a more factually accurate answer than the user query alone.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is DSPy?\nDSPy is a framework that helps developers build pipelines using language models (LMs) similar to LangChain or LlamaIndex.\n\nDSPy introduces signatures and modules to enable developers to define LM-based programs similarly to neural network architectures in PyTorch. After you have defined your DSPy program, you can use some sample data, an optimizer (called teleprompter in DSPy), a metric, and a DSPy compiler to optimize your DSPy program, similarly to how you would train a neural network with training data, an optimizer, and a metric.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
